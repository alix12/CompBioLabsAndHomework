### Biological Question:
 - Are my samples contaminated?
 - more clearly: are the blank/control samples of my data different than the non-blank samples?

### Context
 My data was collected to identify ways of cultivating a specific type of bacteria called methylotrophs. Theses bacteria are able to degrade methanol in order to either grow or produce energy. They are quite ubiquitous in the soil and in decaying vegetation. These types of bacteria are understudied, and difficult to grow in the lab, which is why I am attempting to cultivate them for my project. Unfortunately the "first looks" at my data tell me that there is likely contamination between my samples and blanks.

### Methods
My data consists of 16S rRNA identified OTUs (at 97% similarity) from soils of differing pH. There were multiple factors recorded:

 - pH of soil
 - pH of media used
 - Methanol presence in the media
 - Whether or not the sample was a blank (does not contain soil)
 - Sample ID
 
The size of the data
 - the map file is a data frame with 189 objecs of 4 variables
 - the data set table (OTU Table) is a data frame with 553 observations (different OTUs) with 189 variables (samples and blanks - aka sample IDs and factors)

What I did was look at various aspects of the data, like looking at a PCoA plot, and testing significance of the difference between the blank and non-blank samples using a PERMANOVA.

### Results and Conclusions

##### Discussion and next steps

So according to the visual representation on the PCoA Plot, it doesn't look like the samples are really that diferent between the non-blank samples (n) and the yes blank samples (y). When we check the statistical significance of this by using a permanova, we see the difference between them are actually statistically significant with a 0.001 value. 

The next step I need to take with my data is to figure out how to find a way to "subtract" the blank sample OTUs from the actual data sample OTUs, and to continue on to find out if pH is an importand factor when cultivating methylotrophs.
